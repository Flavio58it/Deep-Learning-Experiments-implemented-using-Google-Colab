Colab Compatible FastAI notebooks for NLP and Computer Vision Datasets

Computer Vision Projects


https://github.com/navneetkrc/Colab_fastai/blob/master/Intel_Image_Classification3.ipynb
This is a Google Colab Notebook on the Intel Image Classification hosted on the Analytics Vidhya
In this There are 17034 images in train and 7301 images in test data.
The categories of natural scenes and their corresponding labels in the dataset are as follows -
'buildings' -> 0,
'forest' -> 1,
'glacier' -> 2,
'mountain' -> 3,
'sea' -> 4,
'street' -> 5
Reached 95% accuracy on the validation data, in order to classifiy with more accuracy need to handle the mislabelled data that we provide as part of training data, for now it is not done as it is more time taking.

https://github.com/navneetkrc/Colab_fastai/blob/master/food_image.ipynb
This is Google Colab Notebook for the Food Data Hackathon hosted by Rakuten in which I got good accuracy almost Top 10 but was not able to submit the test results, after the added documentation in the FASTAI library testing for the test data and adding for that has become more convenient and same has been applied in the Intel Image Classification Challenge as well.

NLP Based Projects


https://github.com/navneetkrc/Colab_fastai/blob/master/Medicine_review_ULMFiT_fastai_Short.ipynb
This is a Google Colab Notebook on the medicinal dataset provided on Kaggle
!kaggle datasets download -d jessicali9530/kuc-hackathon-winter-2018

In this I created a subtask of getting the reviews and the Rating. I have created a Classifier model in which I predict the Rating that a user would give based just only on text.
Next iterations I will add more columns and see how adding those columns will affect the results.

AV_Funny_Jokes
https://github.com/navneetkrc/Colab_fastai/blob/master/AV_Funny_jokes.ipynb
is a dataset provided by Analytics Vidhya where they provide text dataset of jokes and then based on different users and joke we predict what rating would a new user give to the joke.

NewsGroup DataSet
https://github.com/navneetkrc/Colab_fastai/blob/master/NewsGroup_ULMFiT_fastai_Text_Classification.ipynb
is the first project in NLP, in this we used a lot of sklearn data handling as well and suggest this to be your first dataset as well to check your understanding.

FASTAI Movie Review 
https://github.com/navneetkrc/Colab_fastai/blob/master/fast_ai_movie_review.ipynb
This is just the Colab Implementation of the Lecture in FASTAIV3 for the NLP example.

Yelp Movie Review using FASTAI V1
https://github.com/navneetkrc/Colab_fastai/blob/master/YELP_review_ULMFiT_fastai_Short.ipynb
Similar to the FASTAI dataset of movie review this one is also there, very big dataset and that is the only thing that restricts us for now in training in the Google Colab envirionment, rest is ready and well documented
