Colab Compatible FastAI notebooks for NLP and Computer Vision Datasets

https://github.com/navneetkrc/Colab_fastai/blob/master/Medicine_review_ULMFiT_fastai_Short.ipynb
This is a Google Colab Notebook on the medicinal dataset provided on Kaggle
!kaggle datasets download -d jessicali9530/kuc-hackathon-winter-2018

In this I created a subtask of getting the reviews and the Rating. I have created a Classifier model in which I predict the Rating that a user would give based just only on text.
Next iterations I will add more columns and see how adding those columns will affect the results.

AV_Funny_Jokes
https://github.com/navneetkrc/Colab_fastai/blob/master/AV_Funny_jokes.ipynb
is a dataset provided by Analytics Vidhya where they provide text dataset of jokes and then based on different users and joke we predict what rating would a new user give to the joke.
